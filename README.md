Madonna is a simple chatbot application based on the FoundationModels framework that enables users to converse with local models developed by Apple. It is exclusively available to all Apple Intelligence compatible iPhone models running iOS 26+.

Madonna is an experimental interface and is subject to lots of changes both in its function and interface. You may encounter lots of problems with overheating since every five to ten prompts Madonna generates a suitable title and summary for the conversation along with the output. I've conducted many tests on: iPhone 15 Pro / iPhone 16 / iPhone 16 Pro Max. None of these models showed signs of overheating, though the iPhone 16's battery went from 85% to 58% on a 30-minute test.

Any inappropriate responses should be reported under 'Issues'. On the most part, we aren't responsible for those since the models are trained by Apple, but we can try fixing them by tweaking the guidelines.
